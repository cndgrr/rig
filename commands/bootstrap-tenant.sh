# rig bootstrap <role>-box — the box TENANT roles ('-box' names the family: a
# guest, vs the '-server' machine roles): what a box-minted guest becomes
# (issue #31). box mints the thin, creds-free seed (base image, user, rig
# preinstalled — heavy-duty/box#81); rig converges the tenant content that
# used to live in the templates' cloud-init, idempotent and effective-state
# asserted, so an EXISTING box can be re-run to a new spec instead of
# re-minted.
#
# One MECHANISM, parameterized per tenant by a fetched DEFINITION (#110): the
# agent-tenant registry lives in heavy-duty/rig-templates — one directory per
# role (template.env, install.sh, creds.md), resolved through lib/templates.sh
# (RIG_TEMPLATES_DIR > RIG_TEMPLATES_REF > the in-tree pin) — so adding a
# tenant is a data PR there, never an edit here (#109 is the scar: adding
# kimi, pure data, meant editing six files in this repo). The schema also
# describes agentless and hardened tenants through AGENT/HARDEN_SSHD, so the
# registry defines EVERY tenant role and rig's tree defines none (#185).
#
# Creds-free BY CONTRACT: box mints a blank guest and a human converges it by
# hand, from a root shell inside that one box ('box root <box>', then 'rig
# bootstrap claude-box'), so every path here is non-interactive and nothing joins
# or admits — no tailnet, no keys, no prompts. That is also why the registry
# fetch is UNAUTHENTICATED: a converge run that way holds nothing to
# authenticate with.
# An agentless server tenant's tailnet join stays operator-run ('rig bootstrap
# workload-server' through 'box root'), exactly the creds split box#69 designed.
# Convergent: safe to re-run; a second run changes nothing.

Box TENANT roles — what a box-minted guest becomes. box mints the thin,
creds-free seed (base image, user, rig preinstalled); this converges the
tenant on top, and re-runs converge an existing box to a new spec.

  <role>-box          a tenant DEFINED IN THE REGISTRY
                      (heavy-duty/rig-templates) — claude-box, codex-box,
                      grok-box, kimi-box, staging-box, and whatever else the
                      resolved registry defines. Agent definitions converge
                      base tooling, docker, their CLI and context file;
                      AGENT="no" definitions omit that agent surface and
                      HARDEN_SSHD="yes" adds shared server hardening.

  --user <name>       the tenant user the box seed created (default: the
                      definition's USER)

The registry source is three knobs, precedence high to low:
  RIG_TEMPLATES_DIR   a local folder (no fetch — the offline/test path, and
                      "try a template before it exists anywhere")
  RIG_TEMPLATES_REF   a ref of RIG_TEMPLATES_REPO (default
                      heavy-duty/rig-templates), fetched as a tarball
  (neither set)       the ref pinned in rig's tree (lib/templates.sh
                      RIG_TEMPLATES_PIN — bumped by ordinary rig PR, so a
                      rig release freezes the mechanism+registry pair)

Tenant roles are creds-free and non-interactive by contract — box mints a blank
guest and a human converges it by hand, from a root shell inside it (`box root
<box>`, then this command). They take none of the
machine-role traits (--hostname/--root-door/--host/--join): a tenant is a guest,
not a tailnet machine. Run as root, inside the box.

# BEFORE the root check so the refusals are testable non-root, off fixture
# markers (repo precedent: close-root's marker gate). The unconditional
# host=yes refusal already ran before registry resolution. What remains is one
# definition-driven refusal and one tolerance:
#   - a root-door policy (agent tenants) → refuse: an agent box is never a
#     tailnet machine.
#   - root-door=open with host=no (agentless tenants) → PROCEED, and leave the
#     marker alone: that is the guest AFTER its operator-run workload join, and

# And assert it ANSWERS as the tenant user: a CLI that exists but cannot run
# is what cost the last drill (the grok-box template's scar).

# question, answered here).
#
# The reason the marker needs that gate is that it holds TRAITS, and a guest's
# traits and the traits it earns after an operator-run `rig bootstrap workload`
# join are two different, competing statements about one box — so the marker
# has to pick, and it picks the truer one. Provenance has no such conflict.
# "Which rig converged this guest, and when" is a fact whichever bootstrap ran,
# and the two-pair shape composes across them exactly as designed: a staging
# guest later joined as a workload keeps the TENANT bootstrap as its birth —
# that genuinely is when this machine was first converged — and the machine
# bootstrap moves converged_* forward. Skipping the write on a joined guest
# would lose the birth stamp that only this run knows.
#
# One file, not a tenant-shaped second one: the manifest answers a question
# about the MACHINE, and a guest is a machine. The marker already carries
# `tenant=yes` for anyone who needs to know which kind.
