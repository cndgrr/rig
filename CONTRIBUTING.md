# Contributing

This repo is governed by
[heavy-duty/ceremony](https://github.com/heavy-duty/ceremony). **Agents:
read [`.ceremony/AGENTS.md`](.ceremony/AGENTS.md) first** — it routes you to
your role file (builder, reviewer, triage), vendored beside it,
byte-identical to ceremony at the pin named in
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) and
guarded by the `docs-sync` step in CI. The review-round doctrine — drafts,
whole-round replies, verdicts, the handoff — lives there and in
[`.ceremony/LABELS.md`](.ceremony/LABELS.md); this file keeps only what is
genuinely rig's.

## The PR loop, rig specifics

1. **Fork and branch.** Contributors work from forks; upstream branches are
   for maintainers. Title the PR conventionally (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
2. **The review panel.** [`.github/labels.conf`](.github/labels.conf) is the
   governing roster: use `panel[<your-login>]=` when that row exists,
   otherwise `panel=`, then remove the author. In rig the builder marks the
   PR ready, waits for a green head, and requests that resolved panel. The
   labels workflow requests no panelist; its only reviewer request is the
   human at handoff ([reconciler](https://github.com/heavy-duty/ceremony/blob/c64e06689356204c24dd1de35c505b0508070453/actions/labels-reconcile/labels-reconcile.sh#L930-L932)).
   This is rig's answer to BUILDER.md's conditional
   [engine-mediated request rule](.ceremony/BUILDER.md#the-review-round).
   The maintainer (`danmt`) takes the last word and merges.
3. **Checks must be green**: `shellcheck`, `bash test/cli.sh` and
   `bash test/release.sh` locally mirror what CI runs; the db dump/restore
   round-trip (`test/db-integration.sh`) executes in CI where Docker is
   present. The release guards (`changelog-armed`, `changelog-monotonic`,
   `changelog-assembled`, `drill-recorded`, `runner-isolated`, `docs-sync`)
   run as ceremony's pinned actions.
4. **Feature PRs land their changelog entry as part of the PR**: write
   `changelog.d/<issue>.md` — the release PR assembles those fragments into
   the release notes verbatim.
5. **An issue whose criteria outlive the merge is referenced, never closed**:
   such a PR says `Refs #N`, and `refs-guard` now says so instead of a human
   catching it — it reds when a body promising `Refs #N` contradicts GitHub's
   closing-issue graph, on the body **edit** as much as on a push.
6. **A red head you cannot rerun is asked for, not waited on**: every build PR
   here is a fork PR, so its run lives in this repository and only `actions:
   write` here can restart it. Comment the evidence — `🔁 rerun owed at head
   <full-sha>` — and set `rerun-owed`; `ci-rerun` starts the one rerun, clears
   the label and comments the new attempt. A refusal leaves the label standing
   and names the gate that refused, the roster in `.github/labels.conf` being
   the first of them.

## Changelog entries

Every PR that changes behaviour writes one `changelog.d/<issue>.md` fragment.
The fragment keeps the relevant `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed`
heading above its entry. One line is the whole rule — if it wraps more than
twice in your editor, cut it down.

- **Say what changed, and stop.** Why it was wrong, how it was found, what it
  cost, what it implies — that belongs in the PR body and the commit message,
  which is where anyone chasing the reasoning already goes. This file answers
  one question: what is different in this version.
- **Any word that can be removed, is removed.**
- **Lead with the surface, not the mechanism.** "`state:needs-human` is set at
  handoff" beats "the labels workflow now also wakes on `labeled`".
- **Cite the issue or PR** — `(#96)` — and let the reader follow it for the
  rest.
- **Mark a breaking change** with a leading `BREAKING:`.
- Group under `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed` / `### Removed`.
- No bold run-in headings, no sub-paragraphs, no code blocks, no prose essays.

Good:

- `state:needs-human` is set at handoff, not by the cron (#96)
- An unreadable check rollup no longer reads as "nothing is failing" (#90)
- BREAKING: `--class human|server` is now `--root-door closed|open` (#77)

Not an entry — that is a PR body:

- **`state:needs-human` no longer waits on the cron to become true** (#96) —
  the labels workflow now also wakes on `pull_request_target: labeled` and
  `unlabeled`, and the author sets it themselves when handing a PR over. A
  review landing was never a trigger. There is no `pull_request_review_target`,
  and on fork PRs — which is all of them here — ...

## Releasing

A release is a PR, and merging it is the release. The ceremony — the two
doors, the decide table, the stamps, the post-release re-arm — is
heavy-duty/ceremony's machinery, consumed by reference:
[its README](https://github.com/heavy-duty/ceremony/blob/main/README.md)
is the doctrine, `.github/workflows/release.yml` here is the ≤20-line
caller pinning it, and the guards run in `ci.yml` from the same pin.
Bare `X.Y.Z` tags, no `v`; the tag's source tarball is the package the
`curl … | bash` channel downloads, and since #219 a release also carries a
self-contained `rig-<version>.sh` installer and its `.sha256` sidecar, built by
`dist/release-artifact.sh`. Each release deliberately bumps and drills the
`BOX_RELEASE` pin in `commands/bootstrap.sh`; it must never float to a moving
ref.

What stays rig's is the **drill** — the real-hardware gate before the
handoff of a release PR, run by `drill/drill.sh` (#105): `rig bootstrap`
converging the machine to its role twice with the second run diffed empty,
installing Docker directly, and running `test/db-integration.sh`. Rig's drill asserts
**convergence** (a machine reaches its role,
idempotently), it runs `--host yes` with `BOX_REF=release/<box-version>` so
it exercises the box that will actually ship, and drills that share a
substrate share **one run ID** so the per-repo records can be joined after
the fact. The full meaning — how the candidate pair is fixed so the box↔rig
recursion dissolves, the per-version record files, the waiver rule — is
[`drills/README.md`](drills/README.md); the `drill-recorded` guard enforces
the record on every release tree.

**The drill's subject is the tree it ships in** (#220), so getting the
candidate onto the machine is a copy, not a checkout: build the artifact from
the branch under test, `scp` it to a throwaway Debian, install it, and run the
drill out of what landed. There is no `--rig-repo` and no `--rig-ref` — the
drill host needs no repository name, no ref, no clone and no GitHub
credential, and the record's rig fields are measured off the installed tree
rather than echoed back from an argument. [`drill/README.md`](drill/README.md)
is the procedure.

The builder runs the drill when they have a genuine fresh Debian host or VM;
otherwise the operator runs it. An operator posts the instrument's complete
final stdout on the release issue, and the builder copies that attributed
record into `drills/<version>.md` on the release branch. A builder session
already inside a box never runs the host drill there.

## Labels — who sets what

The taxonomy and state machine are
[`.ceremony/LABELS.md`](.ceremony/LABELS.md); rig's `scope:*` rows live in
`.github/labels.conf` (reconciled by the labels caller) and their path map
in `.github/labeler.yml`. What matters day to day is who sets each kind —
most of it is machinery, and hand-moving a machine-owned label just gets
corrected on the next pass:

| Labels | Set by |
|---|---|
| `state:*` | the labels workflows ([.github/workflows/labels.yml](.github/workflows/labels.yml), [`.github/workflows/labels-sweep.yml`](.github/workflows/labels-sweep.yml)) — event-triggered reconciliation is dispatched in seconds, with an hourly sweep for transitions that have no event wake. Machine-owned, with one exception: the author sets `state:needs-human` at handoff and the workflow reconciles it. Otherwise never by hand. Exactly one per PR: *whose ball is it.* |
| `blocker:*` | the same workflow, from the same facts — *what is in the way.* Any number per PR, or none. Never by hand: applying one does not stop a merge, and removing one does not unblock anything. Fix the thing and the next sweep drops the label; for `blocker:unrequested`, the thing is the missing panel request and the builder owes that act. |
| `stale` | the same workflow — 48h without commits, comments, or reviews. `blocked` PRs are exempt: they are quiet legitimately. |
| `scope:*` on PRs | actions/labeler, from the changed paths ([.github/labeler.yml](.github/labeler.yml)). Additive — you may add more, the machine won't remove them. |
| `scope:*` on issues | you, when opening or triaging — issues have no paths to derive from. |
| `blocked`, `release` | you — automation never guesses intent. |
| `rerun-owed` | the builder, beside the evidence comment naming the head. Only a **started** rerun clears it: `ci-rerun` removes it on success and leaves it standing on a refusal, so the label is the ask and its absence the answer. |
| `merge-next` | you or the agent owning the queue. Which PR lands first is a judgement about how they conflict, so the workflow never sets it — it only **clears** it, the moment the PR stops being something a human could merge. |
| `bug` / `enhancement` / `documentation` | you, on issues only — a PR's type already lives in its title. |

## Issues

Give issues the same care as PR titles: say the surface in the title, apply a
`scope:` label and a type label (`bug` / `enhancement` / `documentation`) when
you open one, and `blocked` when it waits on something — that is what keeps
the board navigable as the issue count grows.
