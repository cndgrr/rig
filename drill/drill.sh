# THE SUBJECT IS THE TREE THE HARNESS IS IN (#220). There is no flag pointing
# the drill at a tree somewhere else, because there is no correct use of one:
# separating the instrument from its subject has only ever produced mismatch,
# and a record naming what was REQUESTED rather than what RAN proves nothing
# later. Get the candidate onto the machine — `dist/release-artifact.sh` builds
# one scp-able file — install it, and run the drill out of what landed.
# rig's drill asserts CONVERGENCE — a machine reaches its role, idempotently.
# The legs (drills/README.md, issue #105):
#
#   1. convergence + idempotence — `rig bootstrap <role> --users <path>`
#      reaches the declared role; a re-run produces an EMPTY state diff,
#      mechanically, never by eye. Rides along: the --host yes assertions
#      (the pinned box installed, its host stack stands — and it STOPS there;
#      the isolation boundary is box's drill's assertion, not this one's).
#   2. db — the real dump/restore round-trip, test/db-integration.sh.
#
# Execution order is 1, 2. The drill installs Debian's Docker package directly
# before leg 2 so the db round-trip is real even on a pristine machine. Docker
# provisioning is a prerequisite, not a rig surface or a separate evidence leg.
#
# Exit 0 = no check failed. A FAILED drill still emits a complete record —
# the gate wants evidence, not success — and skipped legs are counted and
# named, never folded into the passes (heavy-duty/box#153's defect class).
#
# The file is one long 'probe && ok "…" || no "…"'. ok/no always return 0, so
# the C-may-run-when-A-is-true trap SC2015 warns about cannot fire here.
# shellcheck disable=SC2015
#
# NOT -e: a failing check is data, not a crash — a drill that aborts on its
# first failure reports one problem per afternoon. NOT pipefail: checks of the
# 'refusal 2>&1 | grep -q text' shape have a left side that exits non-zero BY
# DESIGN, and 'grep -q' SIGPIPEs the left side on early match — box's first
# live run turned both into false FAILs. The pipeline verdict must be grep's
# alone. (box drill/drill.sh's header, the discipline #105 prescribes.)
