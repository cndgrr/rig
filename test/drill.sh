# test/drill.sh — the drill harness's HONESTY, proven without hardware.
#
# drill/drill.sh is the instrument (#105), so what this suite tests is the
# instrument itself: the refusals, the classifications, the capture-and-diff
# that decides idempotence, and the record emitter — the parts whose lies
# would be believed, months later, by a reader of drills/<version>.md. The
# two-leg live run on a real Debian machine is #107's exercise, not this
# file's: nothing here needs root, Docker, a tailnet or the network.
#
# Extraction pattern is test/release.sh's: the functions under test are
# awk-extracted from drill/drill.sh and driven against fixtures, so the tests
# exercise the shipped bytes, and the extraction check itself guards the awk
# against a drifted function boundary.
# Deliberately no `set -e` — the harness asserts on failing commands.
