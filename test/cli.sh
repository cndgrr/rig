# --- the pre-#77 vocabulary, on live markers (#77) ---------------------------
# THIS is the block that makes #77 safe to ship, and it is not a formality.
# Unlike #76's role rename, the root-door trait is written into /etc/rig/role
# and read BACK by this gate, so every box bootstrapped before the rename
# carries `class=human|server` and carries it until someone re-bootstraps it —
# which, for a fleet, is never. A gate that stopped understanding that spelling
# would fail in both directions and both are incidents: `class=human` boxes
# (whose whole point is that root closes) would lose the ability to close it,
# and `class=server` boxes would... also refuse, but for the wrong reason,
# which is luck rather than design and would evaporate the moment the fallthrough
# arm changed.
#
# So the fixtures below stay DELIBERATELY at the retired spelling, byte for
# byte as a real pre-#77 box's marker reads — the same reason #76's
# `pre-rename-cp` fixture keeps `role=control-plane`. Do not "modernize" them:
# updating these fixtures to the new vocabulary would delete the only evidence
# that the compat read works, and the suite would stay green while the field
# broke. The pairs assert the OLD spelling produces the SAME verdict as its new
# equivalent above, refusal text included.
